# 2303ENG Final Project - Robotic Arm Firmware

Final project for 2303ENG Embedded Systems at Griffith University. Firmware designed for the Texas Instruments Tiva TM4C1294NCPDT Microcontroller.
## Project Overview

Project drives a 6-axis robotic arm designed at GU. 6 servo motors are responsible for arm movement, which are controlled through PWM generation. An SPI LED screen is connected to the board to indicate arm position and system information. The arm is controlled via 6x rotary encoders, and control is limited in software to prevent damage.

### Servo Control via PWM
Work in progress.

### LED Screen Interfacing via SPI
Work in progress.

### User Input Management
Work in progress.
